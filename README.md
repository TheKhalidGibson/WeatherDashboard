# WeatherDashboard - Server-Side API

## Task

This challenge was to allow developers to use a third-party API to retrieve data with specific parameters to a URL. Developers many times utilize API's from applications and work with them for their own use. In this challenge a Weather Dashboard was built that consisted of updated dynamic HTML and CSS. Powered by script.

The openweathermap.org site was used to compile data and access an authentic API key/API id. [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

With these tools developers can now find the weather in any city based upon geographical coordinates.

I also used `localStorage` to store the persistent data. I was able to gather information on how to work with the OpenWeather API by referring to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).


## User Story

```
AS a person with a busy schedule
I WANT to be up to date with the forecast for cities SO THAT traveling will be not only possible but well prepared for
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a dashboard with access to current weather
WHEN a city is searched
THEN I receive results of multiple aspects of weather conditions for the city that was submitted into the search input
WHEN I take a look at the weather presented for that city I can see the city name, the current date, the temperature, the humidity percentage, and the wind speed in MPH
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city 
THEN I am presented with the weather projection for the next 5 days
WHEN I click on the cities searched
THEN I will see the current and future conditions for that city
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality and this was given to me as a guide to use during the development stage:
