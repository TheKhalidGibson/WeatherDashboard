# WeatherDashboard

## Task

This challenge was to allow deveoplers to use a third-party API to retrieve data with specific parameters to a URL. Developers many times utilize API's from applications and work with them for their own use. In this challenge a Weather Dashboard was built that consisted of updated dynamic HTML and CSS. Powered by script.

The openweathermap.org site was used to compile data and access an authentic API key/API id.

With these tools developers can now find the weather in any city based upon geographical coordinates.
